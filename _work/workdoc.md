## Initial take: 

tech noir - setting / world building:
AI is working its way into regular life, inserting itself into every facet of life - often inserting itself into the spots traditionally reserved for human to human interaction. As the level of abstraction between humans increases >>> increased power >>> increased lack of control 

eldritch - developments: 
horror / machine learning / self reinforcing mechanism --- strange math working its way into evolutions, morphing intentions of AI

what to do: 
heist / supernatural heist // sabotage the thing, blow it all up, reinsert a human element. *this, but not this. *

## Outline

### Why (authorâ€™s point of view)

  

### Who (characters)
	- Agonists
		- main character
		- allies
			- 1
			- 2
			- 3
			- 4
	- Antagonists
		- big bad
		- mini bosses
			- 1
			- 2
		- cultists / thralls
			- 'flavors'
			- npc's

### Where (setting)
A parallel version of Earth around 2050. AI has worked its way into every facet of everyday life. Direct human interaction has dropped to an all time low. What is real and what is not is nearly impossible to tell for most. 
### When (mood)
35% of society - and rising: quiet slavery, non person, servitude, drone
60% of society - and shrinking: conscious compliance, servitude, 
5%: of society: active defiance, rebellion

### What happened(events of the plot)

#### "open and then close the brackets"

1. introduction
	- plot points: 
		- main character works on a standard case, but ends up discovering something strange, hinting at larger wheels having been set in motion behind the scenes. 
	- establish setting - tech noir / dystopian future / low fantasy
	- tone - sharp, smart, cynical, individualistic protagonists. Cultists/machines should be more empathetic / collectivist / harmonious / homogenous
	- introduce character and character challenges
	- Opening paragraph:
		needs to establish tone, have motion, feature an active protagonist acting on a goal. It should promise motion and promise change. It does not have to feature introduction to the actual main plot - but should feature some events and motivations that are plot-adjecent in tone and in content.
		*Refer to opening scenes of A new hope or indiana jones. *
		Character promise - set up a desire, a problem, a challenge, a motivation that is acted on / that will intersect with story developments later. 
	
2. explain the problems
	- plot points: 
		- 
	- explain the problems
	- find allies to solve problems
		- problem 1 is solved by solution A,
		- problem 2 is solved by solution B,
		- problem 3 is solved by solution C,
		- problem 4 is solved by solution D.
	-  introduce sub plots for ally development
	- 
3. crisis / break / development
	- something goes horribly wrong
	- the team is weakened, reduced, some ally plot resolution
	- the problems are changed and at the same time the stakes are raised
		- An unexpected / unanticipated development changes the playing field, making problems 1, 2, 3 and 4 irrelevant and introduces problems 5, 6, 7 and 8. 
	- 
4. struggle to resolve new problems
	- character development working through loss, impact, loss of hope, corruption
	- The team discovers that solutions can be employed differently, or combined, to resolve problems 5, 6, 7 and 8 in ways that were not intended. 
	- Build toward second/ last desperate attempt
	- 
5. execute
	- 'it's now or never'
	- the team executes. Not everybody makes it. 
	- success, great stakes are addressed and resolved, several ally storylines are also concluded but (at least) main characters journey is still unresolved
	- 
6. epilogue
	- wrap up remaining ally storylines
	- bring main character's story full circle

### How does it end (resolution)
- plot: the good guys win, but at a price. 
- events are set in motion that will change the course of history - but what exactly can remain open. The big bad's influence is eradicated but the mundane presence has not - and may be even worse to deal with than big bad. (the empire strikes back)
- there should remain a hint of magic / the unknown / the unknowable to spark a part II.

- promises, progress, payoff.
- promises:
	- tone - f.e. funny/whimsical/dark and gritty
	- genre
	- plot -> in the sense of the type of progress that the reader can expect
	- character promise

- 'the italian job' heist story archetype
	- gather a team
	- explain the problem -> problemS
		- problem 1 is solved by solution A,
		- problem 2 is solved by solution B,
		- problem 3 is solved by solution C,
		- problem 4 is solved by solution D.
	- An unexpected / unanticipated development changes the playing field, making problems 1, 2, 3 and 4 irrelevant and introduces problems 5, 6, 7 and 8. 
	- The team discovers that solutions can be employed differently, or combined, to resolve problems 5, 6, 7 and 8 in ways that were not intended. 
		- *Really like the parallel with IT problem solving here.
	- success!
