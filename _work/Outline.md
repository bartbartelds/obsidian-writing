NNY in 2091 is a vast metropolis. Its skyline is made up of monoliths containing offices and domiciles of varying degrees of luxury. Looking to the east, the horizon is littered with facilities of industry and data centers feeding the dying financial system. 

Within the city, tensions have been rising between corporations, both foreign and domestic. The political administration only has a tenuous hold the city. At street level, several gangs have risen to prominence, laying claim to entire blocks as they please. The richer neighbourhoods and valuable corporate sites are well kept through police attention and private security details, but the further one ventures from these sheltered communities, the more one has to be able to fend for one's self. 

Some people can work a job, but for those who are down in social credit, most careers on the straight and narrow are closed off forever. (Credit card / credit rating agencies have taken over personal screening in combination with a China-esque system of public monitoring - widening the gap between rich and poor, and creating a large underclass of people who will work for next to nothing in order to stay afloat.)

The belongings she could rescue from the apartment where she was raised, are stacked in hastily packed boxed, piled unstable towers in the back room of her office, surrounding a rickety stretcher and a few cupboards of clothes. She's not supposed to live there, but she does. Building 407 is home to many smaller enterprises. The landlord is magnanimous, as long as she pays on time and lets him hang on to the illusion of having a shot. 

Right now, Phi is working on an assassination. It's the biggest pay day she's had in a while, and she could use a break. And some actual food, instead of the synthetic slop she's been eating for the last weeks. Intel on the target was hazy at best. The customer, a business man named Seven, connected her to a vac addict called Druno.
