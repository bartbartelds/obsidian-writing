Photochemical smog is produced when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC) in the atmosphere. Nitrogen oxides come from car exhaust, coal power plants, and factory emissions. VOCs are released from gasoline, paints, and many cleaning solvents. When sunlight hits these chemicals, they form airborne particles and ground-level ozone—or smog.  
  
Ozone can be helpful or harmful. The ozone layer high in the atmosphere protects us from the sun’s dangerous ultraviolet radiation. But when ozone is close to the ground, it is bad for human health. Ozone can damage lung tissue, and it is especially dangerous to people with respiratory illnesses like asthma. Ozone can also cause itchy, burning eyes.

Smog is unhealthy to humans and animals, and it can kill plants. Smog is also ugly. It makes the sky brown or gray. Smog is common in big cities with a lot of industry and traffic. Cities located in basins surrounded by mountains may have smog problems because the smog is trapped in the valley and cannot be carried away by wind. Los Angeles, California, United States, and Mexico City, Mexico, both have high smog levels partly because of this kind of landscape.

Phi draws laboured breaths through the moist rag that acts as an improvised filtering filament in her face mask. It has already begon to discolor at the center, where most air is pulled through. She wipes beads of sweat and grime from her forehead after setting down her heavy duffle bag on the dust covered concrete. 

"Only places with elevators from now on." she hisses through gritted teeth as she kneels and zips open the length of the bag in one smooth motion, revealing an arsenal of death within. She rummages, extracts several long parts and begins assembly of her overwatch rifle. The process is rehearsed, and performed as in a trance. Phi perks a thin smile as she oils interconnects and inserts pieces, feeling them interlock with a satisfying near silent click. It takes three minutes and fifteen seconds to complete assembly. Another two to affix the silencer, the feet propping up the nuzzle. And finally 90 seconds to roll out a seven foot long ground mat, position the weapon and get in position. 

Phi connects the link from her visor to the hud socket of the weapon and flicks up a switch. Her field of view dims to black. causing the visor to flicker with static
