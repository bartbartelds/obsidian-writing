Photochemical smog is produced when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC) in the atmosphere. Nitrogen oxides come from car exhaust, coal power plants, and factory emissions. VOCs are released from gasoline, paints, and many cleaning solvents. When sunlight hits these chemicals, they form airborne particles and ground-level ozone—or smog.  
  
Ozone can be helpful or harmful. The ozone layer high in the atmosphere protects us from the sun’s dangerous ultraviolet radiation. But when ozone is close to the ground, it is bad for human health. Ozone can damage lung tissue, and it is especially dangerous to people with respiratory illnesses like asthma. Ozone can also cause itchy, burning eyes.

Smog is unhealthy to humans and animals, and it can kill plants. Smog is also ugly. It makes the sky brown or gray. Smog is common in big cities with a lot of industry and traffic. Cities located in basins surrounded by mountains may have smog problems because the smog is trapped in the valley and cannot be carried away by wind. Los Angeles, California, United States, and Mexico City, Mexico, both have high smog levels partly because of this kind of landscape.

Phi draws laboured breaths through the moist rag tightly tied across her nos and mouth. It has already begon to discolor at the center, a thin film of soot and oily grime forming on the exterior. She wipes beads of sweat from her forehead after setting down her heavy duffle bag on the dust covered concrete. 

"Only places with functional elevators from now on." she hisses through gritted teeth as she kneels and zips open the length of the bag in one smooth motion, revealing an arsenal of death within. She rummages, extracts several long parts and begins assembly of her overwatch rifle. The process is rehearsed, and performed as in a trance. Phi perks a thin smile as she oils interconnects and inserts pieces, feeling them interlock with a satisfying near silent click. It takes three minutes and fifteen seconds to complete assembly. Another two to affix the silencer, the feet propping up the nuzzle. And finally 90 seconds to roll out a seven foot long ground mat, position the weapon and get in position. 

Phi connects the link from her visor to the hud socket of the weapon and flicks up a switch. Her field of view dims to a soft black, only leaving a red pulsing dot in the bottom right. The visor flickers with static which quickly settles into three white squares along the top of Phi's vision,  and projected green crosshair with wind and distance data in the middle and along the bottom a string of weapon diagnostics. 

"Online" she states matter of factly. 
A gruff distorted voice replies "Patching you in now."

One by one, the white squares along the top of Phi's field of view begin showing an intersection of streets that are fully obfuscated from her perch by layers of thick smog. Software projects a dot where the weapon is aiming on every panel, offering a near perfect 360 view of the point of projected impact - useful when firing rounds with sufficient stopping power to plough through several layers of semi-solid obstacles before running out of dynamic energy. 

The intersection was desolate at 3:22AM. Scraps of trash, caught in the breeze, flit across the screen and curtains of dust fly by. Phi feels a something sharp jab at her right elbow as she stretches out, positioning herself prone and in position to operate the weapon. She outs an inmouth curse and brushes the weathered concrete with her hands. 

"Tic toc, killer."
Phi scowls. "Don't appreciate that, none of it."
In the static that follows, she was su
