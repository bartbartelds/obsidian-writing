Prompt:
17. A family inherits a cursed heirloom with deadly consequences.

"Alright, now what?"
The executor undoes the two latches of his leather attache case in unison with a wry smile, and reaches in to present a diminutive black box. Its texture seems to be wood, but appears deceptively small. With a clunk, it settles in the middle of the oak desk. 
"Now it's yours, Mr. Greene."
"This is not quite what I was expecting."
The executor sits back in his chair and breathes a long sigh. He wipes his brow, recovering from a great effort. I can almost see his heart thrashing about in his chest. He nods. 
"I understand. But this is it - the grand sum of the estate."
I lean in, peering at the exterior of the box, looking for hints to its nature. Pores, signs of workmanship. 
"So it's all .. in there?"
"In a manner of speaking, Mr. Greene. It is yours to take. I invite you to collect it. You'll find it quite light."
I frown, and reach for the artefact. It is cold to the touch. To my surprise it lifts off the desktop with ease. 
"That will be all, Mr. Greene."
I manage a soft thank you, and leave the executor's office carrying my freshly bequeathed prize before me like a votive offering. 

Once outside, I give the box a shake. A soft thump of something rattling against its insides makes my mind race. 
*No - not here.* 
I am unsure where the notion came from, but I decide to heed it, and drive home in silence with the box beside me, nestled in the passenger's seat. 

"What is it? Does it do anything?"
"What's -in- it? Aren't you curious?"
I've been pondering it the entire ride, and ever since I got home, the box has not left my mind. The kids must think it's Christmas Eve, and Santa has just walked in with a bounty of presents. I'm sure of it, this time. I don't want to know what's in there. 
"Leave it alone. We'll open it soon." I lie. 
"When? When??" they cry in unison. 
"Later."

The box sat on a side table in the hallway a few hours, until the kids went to bed. I secreted it away, hid it in the attic, and tried to forget about it, hoping the kids would do the same. It worked. They stopped mentioning the heirloom after a day or so, and moved on to things that were infinitely more important in teenager's lives. 

*Wake up.*
I do. With a groan I push off of the mattress to sit against the headboard. I flip on the reading light, and squint as my eyes adjust. The box sits atop the memoir a friend of mine wrote. 
"What ..."

*It's time.*
"Wha ..." I shake my head in an attempt to rid myself off some cobwebs. It's still there. 
*You must be curious.*
I'm not. 
"Yes ... I must be ..." I mime the words. 
I reach over with my right hand and pick up the keepsake, placing it on my stomach. 

*Go on.*
I do. 

The kids found the box the next morning. They waited for me to return
