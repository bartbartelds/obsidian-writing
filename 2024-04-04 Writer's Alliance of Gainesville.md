"Where do we go from here?" Words not spoken, but rather heard, cascading through the candlelit living room. They formed the conclusion of a radio play written and narrated by William Mosely, a mostly forgotten playwright who made moderate local waves in the northeast, back in the '40s. The play carried the same title as its ending. Back in the day it was mostly ignored by its listeners. This trend has mostly persisted. 

Harry was not quite asleep. He had allowed himself to be lead into deep relaxation, slumped down in an arm chair, and kept what remained of his focus on the mercurial flame that sat atop the candle on the small coffee table, amidst a mound of unsorted manuscripts, half-read books and the odd newspaper. The question made him smirk, nearly scowl. 

He groaned upright, and settled into a seating position. The struggle made the veins in his neck thrum with the elevated pulse of his heart. With his left hand, he rubbed his eyes, driving toward the nose. The right steadied his posture on the armrest. After a stretch and a yawn, he stands. 

Mary is covered in blankets, teetering on the edge of the chesterfield sofa, and covered under blankets, throws, comforters and pillows. An uncovered foot and hand have wrestled free from the heat, and dangle limp just above the wooden floor.

The ambient chill embraces him as he takes note of the empty bottles of scotch and the spent crystal decanter set on the drinks cabinet along the wall leading to the kitchen. Had there been more than a few candles lit, he'd have seen the bespoke bookcases stacked with leather-bound volumes that he knew had never been read. In the modest flicker of the remaining candle, he could only make out a suggestion of their outline.
