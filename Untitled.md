She arrived like a wisp on the moors, when nearly all lamps in town had doused for the night.  The regulars circled her, pouring out of the saloon once they laid eyes on her. She met them  atop a white horse, wearing a white gown that drifted gently in the cool breeze. They led her inside, and furnished her with food and drink which she did not touch. Come morning, she was gone. 
Rumours began to come down the coast of a lady in white seen on the marshes when all other lights had gone out. She became known as a patron saint of travellers, a guide over treacherous ground. They called her Aster, after the white marsh flower.
The next time she arrived in town, the major wasted no time offering her accommodation. The morning after, they found she had taken residence in an abandoned house on the outskirts. 

"Y'all ain't been here long. But Wren's takin' a liking to y'all. Y'know that, right?"
Aster looks up from her broom. Her eyes meet Avery's, followed by a nod. 
" ... if it'd been up to him, y'all could stay right here for 'nother 100 years." 
In the dim light of the lamp overhead, he reaches for a tin of tobacco and stuffs an indulgent helping in his left cheek. He grins his teeth black. 
"... Problem is: this house ain't ol' Wren's to give. It was built by my grandpappy, and I aims to keep it. But my heart ain't of stone neither. So here's what we'll do, miss: y'all come out tomorrow and stand in the Proceeding. And if y'all see fit to accommodate us, well ... we'll accommodate y'all. How's that sound?"
As Avery stows away his tin, Aster meets his eyes with a disarming smile. He clears his throat, and mutters a groan as he gets up. 
"... well then. Y'all 'll know when it's time." 

A restless mob of townsfolk gathers in the early dawn. The minister's blessing from the minister instills little calm. Big Wren takes center stage. Aster stands in the middle of a dais, dressed in her finest white gown. Wren clears his throat.
"The date is April 21st in the year of our Lord 1766 ..." He pauses, letting his words roll down main street. "... a decennary to the day since the last Proceeding. Today, we pay our Retribution." 
Aster looks out over the crowd. No one meets her calm smile.
"Miss Aster has seen fit to Stand at this time. And for this we owe her a hundred years of Gratitude." 
The gathering repeats the last five words in unison.
Wren then raises both his arms and voice skyward. "We stand ready, Gray Man. Come claim your prize." 
The townsfolk wait in heavy silence. 

"There!" Wren points down street. The Gray Man emerges from the morning mist at the edge of town, astride a pale horse. He looks translucent, garbed in grey cloth and black leathers. The horse's hoofs grind gravel with deep thuds as it advances. The gathering splits to allow him passage. 

Aster steps forward. She caresses the horse's manes gently, and takes the black gloved hand held out to her. The Gray Man hoists her up and she melts against his back, embracing him at the waist. The bewildered townsfolk look on as Aster and the Gray Man ride off into the morning mist.

Avery lead the Proceeding in '76, but the Gray Man didn't show - nor did he the decade after. The town stood in prosperity until the flash floods of 1866 washed it out to sea.
