Returns on homework: 
- Realism tends to have loose versions of building blocks. A more open ending works with realism.
- Locations in realism: be very specific / lean into the idiosyncrasies of the setting
- Sometimes, when you don't know the nature and behavior of a character, compare them to an animal.
- When you have multiple characters and you want to have everyone react to something - choose a focal body part that their reaction can hinge on.
