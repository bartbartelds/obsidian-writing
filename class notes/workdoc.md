## Initial take: 

tech noir - setting / world building:
AI is working its way into regular life, inserting itself into every facet of life - often inserting itself into the spots traditionally reserved for human to human interaction. As the level of abstraction between humans increases >>> increased power >>> increased lack of control 

eldritch - developments: 
horror / machine learning / self reinforcing mechanism --- strange math working its way into evolutions, morphing intentions of AI

what to do: 
heist / supernatural heist // sabotage the thing, blow it all up, reinsert a human element. *this, but not this. *

### Where (setting)

### When (mood)

### What happened(events of the plot)

#### "open and then close the brackets"

1. introduction
	- establish setting - tech noir / dystopian future / low fantasy
	- tone - sharp, smart, cynical, individualistic protagonists. Cultists/machines should be more empathetic / collectivist / harmonious / homogenous
	- plot
	- introduce character and character challenges
	- Opening paragraph:
		needs to establish tone, have motion, feature an active protagonist acting on a goal. It should promise motion and promise change. It does not have to feature introduction to the actual main plot - but should feature some events and motivations that are plot-adjecent in tone and in content.

		*Refer to opening scenes of A new hope or indiana jones. *

		Character promise - set up a desire, a problem, a challenge, a motivation that is acted on / that will intersect with story developments later. 

2. explain the problems
	- explain the problems
	- find allies to solve problems
		- problem 1 is solved by solution A,
		- problem 2 is solved by solution B,
		- problem 3 is solved by solution C,
		- problem 4 is solved by solution D.
	-  introduce sub plots for ally development
	- 
3. crisis / break / development
	- something goes horribly wrong
	- the team is weakened, reduced, some ally plot resolution
	- the problems are changed and at the same time the stakes are raised
		- An unexpected / unanticipated development changes the playing field, making problems 1, 2, 3 and 4 irrelevant and introduces problems 5, 6, 7 and 8. 
	- 
4. struggle to resolve new problems
	- character development working through loss, impact, loss of hope, corruption
	- The team discovers that solutions can be employed differently, or combined, to resolve problems 5, 6, 7 and 8 in ways that were not intended. 
	- Build toward second/ last desperate attempt
	- 
1. execute
	- 'it's now or never'
	- the team executes. Not everybody makes it. 
	- success, great stakes are addressed and resolved, several ally storylines are also concluded but (at least) main characters journey is still unresolved
	- 
2. epilogue
	- wrap up remaining ally storylines
	- bring main character's story full circle


### How does it end (resolution)
