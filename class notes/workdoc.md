## Initial take: 

tech noir - setting / world building:
AI is working its way into regular life, inserting itself into every facet of life - often inserting itself into the spots traditionally reserved for human to human interaction. As the level of abstraction between humans increases >>> increased power >>> increased lack of control 

eldritch - developments: 
horror / machine learning / self reinforcing mechanism --- strange math working its way into evolutions, morphing intentions of AI

what to do: 
heist / supernatural heist // sabotage the thing, blow it all up, reinsert a human element. *this, but not this. *


## Outline

### Notes

- promises, progress, payoff.
- promises:
	- tone - f.e. funny/whimsical/dark and gritty
	- genre
	- plot -> in the sense of the type of progress that the reader can expect
	- character promise

- 'the italian job' heist story archetype
	- gather a team
	- explain the problem -> problemS
		- problem 1 is solved by solution A,
		- problem 2 is solved by solution B,
		- problem 3 is solved by solution C,
		- problem 4 is solved by solution D.
	- An unexpected / unanticipated development changes the playing field, making problems 1, 2, 3 and 4 irrelevant and introduces problems 5, 6, 7 and 8. 
	- The team discovers that solutions can be employed differently, or combined, to resolve problems 5, 6, 7 and 8 in ways that were not intended. 
		- *Really like the parallel with IT problem solving here.
	- success!

### Opening paragraph 
needs to establish tone, have motion, feature an active protagonist acting on a goal. It should promise motion and promise change. It does not have to feature introduction to the actual main plot - but should feature some events and motivations that are plot-adjecent in tone and in content.

*Refer to opening scenes of A new hope or indiana jones. *

Character promise - set up a desire, a problem, a challenge, a motivation that is acted on / that will intersect with story developments later.
