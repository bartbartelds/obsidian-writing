How to concept and structure stories -> try snow/star

![[ana_func_4.png]]

Alternatively, create a story thread covering seven main events. This approach can help you write from event to event. (Consider writing the same way you would approach rp storytelling.)

Challenge: complete a full short story over the course of the next couple of weeks. 


Not genre specific / tones: 
Drama < - > Comedy
Past - now - future
realistic <-> supernatural

Genre types - note that pretty much every genre can be crossed-over / mixed / warped / borrow elements from other genres and subgenres. Paying attention to which genre you're writing will allow you to focus on some of the general concepts and tropes associated with that genre, and will give your readers something to latch onto.
