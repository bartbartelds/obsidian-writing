Long fiction: offers immersion and character development
Short fiction: offers a specific emotional punch

## MICE
The types of storylines you can have in a story can be lumped into four categories:
```
- <M>ilieu: related to entering and leaving spaces
- <I>>nquiry: related to a question that needs solving
- <C>haracter: related to a personal problem, and ends when the status quo changes; focused on the interior of the character
- <E>vent: Oh noes! - {conflicts} - Ta-da!; focused on the exterior
```
### Conflicts:
The {conflicts} are events that stop your character from reaching their goal. 
``
- Milieu: "Hello!" - "there must be some kinda way outta here..." - "Goodbye!"
- Inquiry: Aroo?! - No answers for you! - Aha!
- Character: ANGST!!! - "Woe is me!" - Ahhh..
- Event: Oh noes! - I am not left-handed - Ta-da!

### Threads
Most stories don't have a single MICE-thread - that tends to be very boring, it's common to have multiple. 

When using multiple MICE elements, you should try to open and resolve them in order.
