Long fiction: offers immersion and character development
Short fiction: offers a specific emotional punch

## MICE
The types of storylines you can have in a story can be lumped into four categories:
```
- <M>ilieu: related to entering and leaving spaces
- <I>>nquiry: related to a question that needs solving
- <C>haracter: related to a personal problem, and ends when the status quo changes; focused on the interior of the character
- <E>vent: Oh noes! - {conflicts} - Ta-da!; focused on the exterior
```
## Conflicts
The {conflicts} are events that stop your character from reaching their goal. 
```
- <M>ilieu: "Hello!" - "there must be some kinda way outta here..." - "Goodbye!"
- <I>nquiry: Aroo?! - No answers for you! - Aha!
- <C>haracter: ANGST!!! - "Woe is me!" - Ahhh..
- <E>vent: Oh noes! - I am not left-handed - Ta-da!
```
## Threads
Most stories don't have a single MICE-thread - that tends to be very boring, it's common to have multiple. 

When using multiple MICE elements, you should try to open and resolve them, with resolution happening in reverse in order, so: 
```
<M> <I> </I> </M>
```

Example: The Wizard of Oz
```
<C> Dorothy is unhappy with her life as a common Kansas farm girl, and pines for adventure
<E> Tornado! 
<M> Welcome to Oz!
<I> What do the ruby slippers do?
</I> Glenda shows up and explains the slippers can take Dorothy home
</M> Leaving Oz
</E> The mess of the tornado has been cleaned up
</C> Dorothy realises she could find adventure in her own back yard
```

## Length
How long your story will likely be, is largely dependent on how many elements you want to address in it. As a rule of thumb: 
```
L = ((C + S) * 750 * M) / 1.5

L = Length
C = Characters
S = Stages / Scenic locations
M = MICE threads
```
## Structure
250 words flash fiction

1. Opening - 3 sentences, in no particular order: 
- who: introduce the character, attach an archetype to him/her to define their attitude(s), introduced through an action. What are they doing? 
- where: location, introduced through to a sensory detail
- genre: mention something specific and unique, that grounds the story in a genre

2. Introduce the conflict and the try/fail cycle - 2 sentences
- what is the character trying to do and why
- what is stopping them from succeeding
- in flash fiction / short form writing, you can imply several try/fail cycles have already happened

3. Look at the conflict/complication you came up with above, and identify the MICE element you're dealing with. Then operate the try/fail cycle for the MICE threads - have the character try, fail and adapt. 5 sentences
- YES, but -> the character makes progress but a new complication pops up
- NO, and -> the character does not make progress, and is pushed back further from it. 

5. At 66% / 75% you begin to resolve threads, meaning you switch modes. 5 sentences, use resolution devices:
- YES, and -> the character succeeds and finds a bonus on top of it
- NO, but -> the character fails but in doing so discovers another outcome

6. Close out the MICE elements in order. Things have changes over the course of the story, and the reader must now be grounded in the new reality. You can do this by taking the results from the cycles. 3 sentences, use mirroring of the introduction:
- Character: action / reflection
- Where: again, mention a sensory details
- Genre: highlight the current/new mood
