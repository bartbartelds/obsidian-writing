Long fiction: offers immersion and character development
Short fiction: offers a specific emotional punch

## MICE
The types of storylines you can have in a story can be lumped into four categories:
```
- <M>ilieu: related to entering and leaving spaces
- <I>>nquiry: related to a question that needs solving
- <C>haracter: related to a personal problem, and ends when the status quo changes; focused on the interior of the character
- <E>vent: Oh noes! - {conflicts} - Ta-da!; focused on the exterior
```
## Conflicts
The {conflicts} are events that stop your character from reaching their goal. 
```
- <M>ilieu: "Hello!" - "there must be some kinda way outta here..." - "Goodbye!"
- <I>nquiry: Aroo?! - No answers for you! - Aha!
- <C>haracter: ANGST!!! - "Woe is me!" - Ahhh..
- <E>vent: Oh noes! - I am not left-handed - Ta-da!
```
## Threads
Most stories don't have a single MICE-thread - that tends to be very boring, it's common to have multiple. 

When using multiple MICE elements, you should try to open and resolve them, with resolution happening in reverse in order, so: 
```
<M> <I> </I> </M>
```

Example: The Wizard of Oz
```
<C> Dorothy is unhappy with her life as a common Kansas farm girl, and pines for adventure
<E> Tornado! 
<M> Welcome to Oz!
<I> What do the ruby slippers do?
</I> Glenda shows up and explains the slippers can take Dorothy home
</M> Leaving Oz
</E> The mess of the tornado has been cleaned up
</C> Dorothy realises she could find adventure in her own back yard
```
