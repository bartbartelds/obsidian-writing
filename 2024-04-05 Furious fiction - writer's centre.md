## Prompt and criteria

**Here are your creative criteria for this month:**

- **Your story’s first sentence must be a question.** (See more details below.)
- **Your story must include something being pulled.**
- **Your story must include the words POST, TEAR and THUNDER.**  
    (Longer words are okay as long as they BEGIN with these words above.)

Your story must be a maximum of 500 words. Hyphenated words and contractions each count as just one word – and we’ll be featuring our TOP PICK and a selection of our favourite stories at the end of the month.

QUESTIONABLE MOTIVES  
The job of any story’s opening – be it 500 words or 500,000 – is to engage the reader; hook them into wanting to read on. One way to do this immediately is with a question, don’t you think?

- Often this is done with a strong ‘narrator’ voice – literally directing a question at the reader. (E.g. ‘Do you believe in fairies?’ OR ‘What makes a perfect day?’) The POV is usually revealed in the subsequent sentences – i.e. ‘Do you believe in fairies? Tom and Jane hadn’t, but now here they were.’ (3rd person) OR ‘What makes a perfect day? I had wondered that many times.’ (1st person).
- A closer 1st person perspective can also be revealed in the question itself – such as an inner monologue. (E.g. ‘What was I thinking?’)
- The question might be more rhetorical in nature – a general musing that hints at a story’s tone. (E.g. ‘Was there ever a day more perfect for a picnic?’ OR ‘Who wouldn’t want to be a millionaire?’) Look up hypophora, epiplexis and erotesis for specific types of rhetorical questions.
- The question itself might overtly invite the story that follows. (E.g. ‘How did I end up tied upside down and hanging from this flagpole in the first place?’)
- It might come as a form of dialogue. (E.g. “What time do you call this?” OR “Are you Tom?”) BEWARE however – for this challenge, we don’t want to see any ‘she said’ or ‘Jane asked’ tags at the end of this first sentence. It must end with a question mark! (It’ll likely be a stronger opening without the dialogue tag anyway.)
- While questions can often begin with WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN and WHY, don’t limit yourself to them. (E.g. ‘Clowns weren’t that scary, were they?’ OR ‘Have you ever been in love?’) As long as your first sentence makes grammatical sense and ends with that all-important question mark, then who says it can’t be something more imaginative?
- These are just a few pointers. Experiment and have fun!

"Not tonight, ok?" 
Phi pulls her head between her knees. Her back quivers as she exhales, her breath warm and damp. Fifth drapes a blanket over her, capturing both heat and moisture. 
"We'll talk tomorrow. Rest now - you're on the verge of ..."
She hears his monotone voice trail off, become one with the ambient noise of machinery, and then nothing. 

The next afternoon came quicker than expected. Phi stirs in a meek attempt to liberate herself from the mound of laundry and bed linnen she found herself under. She snarls but is ultimately successful in emerging from her cloth chrysalis. 
"Too much of a good thing." She pants, wiping sweat off her brow. The room is a war zone, a temporary haven for vagrants, junkies, rapists. She looks back at the sweaty outline she had produced last night, under the overt covers.
"Rough night, huh?" Fifth enters from a side room, and carries two cans of dog food filled with a black warm liquid
