QUESTIONABLE MOTIVES  
The job of any story’s opening – be it 500 words or 500,000 – is to engage the reader; hook them into wanting to read on. One way to do this immediately is with a question, don’t you think?

- Often this is done with a strong ‘narrator’ voice – literally directing a question at the reader. (E.g. ‘Do you believe in fairies?’ OR ‘What makes a perfect day?’) The POV is usually revealed in the subsequent sentences – i.e. ‘Do you believe in fairies? Tom and Jane hadn’t, but now here they were.’ (3rd person) OR ‘What makes a perfect day? I had wondered that many times.’ (1st person).
- A closer 1st person perspective can also be revealed in the question itself – such as an inner monologue. (E.g. ‘What was I thinking?’)
- The question might be more rhetorical in nature – a general musing that hints at a story’s tone. (E.g. ‘Was there ever a day more perfect for a picnic?’ OR ‘Who wouldn’t want to be a millionaire?’) Look up hypophora, epiplexis and erotesis for specific types of rhetorical questions.
- The question itself might overtly invite the story that follows. (E.g. ‘How did I end up tied upside down and hanging from this flagpole in the first place?’)
- It might come as a form of dialogue. (E.g. “What time do you call this?” OR “Are you Tom?”) BEWARE however – for this challenge, we don’t want to see any ‘she said’ or ‘Jane asked’ tags at the end of this first sentence. It must end with a question mark! (It’ll likely be a stronger opening without the dialogue tag anyway.)
- While questions can often begin with WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN and WHY, don’t limit yourself to them. (E.g. ‘Clowns weren’t that scary, were they?’ OR ‘Have you ever been in love?’) As long as your first sentence makes grammatical sense and ends with that all-important question mark, then who says it can’t be something more imaginative?
- These are just a few pointers. Experiment and have fun!

## Entry


"Where do we go from here?" Words not spoken, but rather heard, cascading through the candlelit living room. They formed the conclusion of a radio play written and narrated by William Mosely, a mostly forgotten playwright who made moderate local waves in the northeast, back in the '40s. The play carried the same title as its ending. Back in the day it was mostly ignored by its listeners. This trend has mostly persisted. 

Harry was not quite asleep. He had allowed himself to be lead into deep relaxation, slumped down in an arm chair, and kept what remained of his focus on the mercurial flame that sat atop the candle on the small coffee table, amidst a mound of unsorted manuscripts, half-read books and the odd newspaper. The question made him smirk, nearly scowl. 

He groaned upright, and settled into a seating position. The struggle made the veins in his neck thrum with the elevated pulse of his heart. With his left hand, he rubbed his eyes, driving toward the nose. The right steadied his posture on the armrest. After a stretch and a yawn, he stands. 

Mary is teetering on the edge of the chesterfield sofa, and covered under blankets, throws, comforters and pillows. An uncovered foot and hand have wrestled free from the heat, and dangle limp just above the wooden floor. 

Harry considers her, and then assesses the room. The ambient chill embraces him as he takes note of the empty bottles of scotch and the spent crystal decanter set on the drinks cabinet along the wall leading to the kitchen. Had there been more than a few candles lit, he'd have seen the bespoke bookcases stacked with leather-bound volumes that he knew had never been read. In the modest flicker of the remaining candle, he could only make out a suggestion of their outline. 



“Do you hear it?”
	The waves crashed upon the shore, foamy tendrils reaching for bare feet in the rapidly cooling sand.  The tide was rolling in as thick storm clouds undulated above.  The dying sun painted with pastel stroked against dark swatches of grey and black, reflecting in the mirror created by the receding waves after saturating the sand.
	She stood still, frozen in place as the salt laden wing picked up, tousling her long dark hair and dancing with her skirt.  The tumultuous rhythm of the deep emerald waves and the rapidly changing sky kept her in a trance as the tempest crept ever closer.  The first bolt of lightning split the sky, flashing bright as it ran from the deep peeling of thunder. Toes suddenly flexed upwards as those icy fingers brushed against them before being pulled away from their prey, but her watch never faltered.
	“You’ve gone out too far.” He said softly.
	“I may not make it back…”
	The first step into the churning waters was shocking, the cold temperature making her want to skip right back out to the warmth of the sand.  She merely ignored it and took another step.  The decision was made.
	Step.
	Step.
	Step.
	With each deliberate step, she waded further into the water, the tugging waves climbing ever higher up her calves to her knows.  The wind tugged at the soaked fabric of her dress, failing to dance with it once again as it began to cling to her form.  A shiver ran up her spine as the waves dove and crashed around her hips. Fingers reached down as another crackle of lightning did, both wanting to desperately touch the sea.
	“What if you lose yourself?” his voice had become gentler, more concerned.
	“You’ll be fine”
	As the waves reached her chest, she stopped and turned, watching as the last rays of the sun faded into dusk.  Behind her the sky flickered and hissed, before her was the growing darkness.  The storm was upon them as the waves turned even more menacing, making her anchor her feet into the sand far below the rising tide. The waves tackled the shore with violent strength, but there was no one there. She could see the remnants of a single set of footprints leading to the water line.
	He was never there.
	A pair of arms wrapped warmly around her shoulders; a firm chest pressed tenderly against her back.  The soft warm cheek rested tenderly against her temple, his breath steady and strong. His arms tightened around her and she raised clammy hands up to grip is wrist.
	“You keep dreaming of a way…” he breathed, pressing further into her, immobilizing her against the chaos around her.
	“But your hands are tied.”
	A deep rumbling hum vibrated against her ear just before he breathed her in, her only response was a sigh.  All she could do was sigh.  The lightning and its corresponding cries of thunder were becoming more consistent, the waves roared around them.  The crisp scent of rapidly approaching rain filled her nostrils as she closed her eyes a moment. There. Just below the maelstrom symphony was something else. Soft. Sweet. A melody calling to her amongst the cacophony.
	“Do you hear it?” he asked once again, eliciting a simple slow nod from her. She knew what her answer meant, what it would do.  There she stood in the rising tide amongst angry waves, the water crashing around her jawline, the current tugging at her treading legs and free-floating dress.  A massive bolt of lightning illuminated everything one last time briefly before all was dark.
