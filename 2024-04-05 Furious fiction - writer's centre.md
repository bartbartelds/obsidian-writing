## Prompt and criteria

**Here are your creative criteria for this month:**

- **Your story’s first sentence must be a question.** (See more details below.)
- **Your story must include something being pulled.**
- **Your story must include the words POST, TEAR and THUNDER.**  
    (Longer words are okay as long as they BEGIN with these words above.)

Your story must be a maximum of 500 words. Hyphenated words and contractions each count as just one word – and we’ll be featuring our TOP PICK and a selection of our favourite stories at the end of the month.

QUESTIONABLE MOTIVES  
The job of any story’s opening – be it 500 words or 500,000 – is to engage the reader; hook them into wanting to read on. One way to do this immediately is with a question, don’t you think?

- Often this is done with a strong ‘narrator’ voice – literally directing a question at the reader. (E.g. ‘Do you believe in fairies?’ OR ‘What makes a perfect day?’) The POV is usually revealed in the subsequent sentences – i.e. ‘Do you believe in fairies? Tom and Jane hadn’t, but now here they were.’ (3rd person) OR ‘What makes a perfect day? I had wondered that many times.’ (1st person).
- A closer 1st person perspective can also be revealed in the question itself – such as an inner monologue. (E.g. ‘What was I thinking?’)
- The question might be more rhetorical in nature – a general musing that hints at a story’s tone. (E.g. ‘Was there ever a day more perfect for a picnic?’ OR ‘Who wouldn’t want to be a millionaire?’) Look up hypophora, epiplexis and erotesis for specific types of rhetorical questions.
- The question itself might overtly invite the story that follows. (E.g. ‘How did I end up tied upside down and hanging from this flagpole in the first place?’)
- It might come as a form of dialogue. (E.g. “What time do you call this?” OR “Are you Tom?”) BEWARE however – for this challenge, we don’t want to see any ‘she said’ or ‘Jane asked’ tags at the end of this first sentence. It must end with a question mark! (It’ll likely be a stronger opening without the dialogue tag anyway.)
- While questions can often begin with WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN and WHY, don’t limit yourself to them. (E.g. ‘Clowns weren’t that scary, were they?’ OR ‘Have you ever been in love?’) As long as your first sentence makes grammatical sense and ends with that all-important question mark, then who says it can’t be something more imaginative?
- These are just a few pointers. Experiment and have fun!

## Entry

500 words
question
something being pulled
post, tear, thunder

"Not tonight, ok?" 
Phi pulls her head between her knees. Her back quivers as she exhales, her breath warm and damp. Fifth drapes a blanket over her, capturing both heat and moisture. 
"We'll talk tomorrow. Rest now - you're on the verge of ..."
She hears his monotone voice trail off, become one with the ambient noise of machinery, and then nothing. 
The next afternoon came quicker than expected. Phi stirs in a meek attempt to liberate herself from the mound of laundry and bed linnen she found herself under. She snarls but is ultimately successful in emerging from her cloth chrysalis. 
"Too much of a good thing." She pants, wiping sweat off her brow. The room is a war zone, a temporary haven for vagrants, junkies, rapists. She looks back at the sweaty outline she had produced last night, under the overt covers.
"Rough night, huh?" Fifth enters from a side room, and carries two cans of dog food filled with a black liquid to a cooler serving as side table. "There."
"Why'd you make two?"
"Hmm?"
"You don't drink coffee. Told me it did things to your stomach."
"The left one is yours."
Phi reaches out and lets her palm graze the right can. Cold. Viscous. She brings the left can of coffee to her lips, and sees a globule of something float in it. She squints as she drinks. Hot liquid, grit and several substances that have no business being there cross her tongue. 
"It's good" Phi nods, stifling a cough. 

Fifth leans over to pull his can closer, and loads a dropper just under its service. An obsidian liquid fills the tube. He then tilts his head back, and administers drops into his eyes. 
"Well?"
"Well what?"
"Last night?"
"Just business. Same old, same old. Nothing to report, officer."
"You look like shit. Probably feel like shit too."

He was right - she felt it all over. Bruises and cuts on her left shoulder, shards of glass lodged in her quadriceps, her hands blasted with dirt and grit embedded in her flesh, her neck and jaw near seized when talking. 

"All in a day's work."
"You can't even stand. I'll fill the tank, soak you for a while."
Phi sputters and coughs a gulp of syn coffee. "... What? No, I have to get back out there. I'll be back toni..."
"I wasn't asking." Fifth interjects, still feeding droplets of fluid into his eyes. His words are calm, non-negotiable. 
"I promised C I'd be back for the handover."
"I'll go."
"WHAT?"
Fifth responds. "I'll handle it in your stead. Not like you're worth a whole lot in your current state anyway. We'll go splitsies on the cheque, how's that?"
Phi would crush the half-empty coffee can, but only drives grit and rocks deeper into her flesh in the attempt. She sighs in resignation. 
"Just be careful. These guys are hopped up on all kinds of crazy."
"I'm sure they are."
Fifth levels his gaze on her, causing black residue to run trails down his cheeks. 
"I'll handle it, Phi. Meds and mask are in the other room. Get some rest."
"... just ..." she whispers, shaking her head. 
"I will." 

Fifth stands and walks over to a bookcase stacked with cases of ammunition. She watches as he pushes a load-out into his wrists and lower arms. 
"You'd better be in that tank when I get back, Phi."
She waves dismissively, downing the last of her coffee. "Yeah, yeah. Don't make me regret this, Fifth. I've pinged C so she doesn't waste you on sight."

He puts on sleeveless tactical armor and nods.
