Marguerite had sequestered herself to the far reaches of the bar, only abandoning her perch twice, to slip through the boisterously drunk crowd and enjoy an awkward cigarette under the parasols of the largely abandoned terrace on the club's doorstep. She didn't interface with anyone - any intoxicated advances were swiftly dissuaded with an avoidant glance and reorienting of stance. Without fail and without attracting undesired advances, she would slink back inside, and end up back on her seat. 

"You sure are making those last", a barman commented, having spied Marguerite's resurgence as well as unanimated state of the beer in the glasses in front of her. 

She flashed an empty smile and began turning away from Geoffrey in a reflex but halted herself halfway.

Behind the briny brawn, there was a peaty warmth. A few feet and an impossible distance away, she glanced at Geoffrey, who had joined the fray along with his colleagues. For a split second their eyes met. He smiled. Appropriately acknowledged, seen, she partook.
