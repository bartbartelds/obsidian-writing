(Picture 20)

We met at work. Many couples do, especially ambitious ones - they seem to attract always, no extra effort is required. Both full of drive, which we did not understand, and potential, which we did not comprehend. And both willing to advance, in whatever way opportunity presented itself. 

It took three months of near daily interaction, and a handful of wine-aided get-togethers after hours for us to hook up. We bonded easily, over plainly visible problems and solutions, over responsibilities and duties. And as soon as we did, we did things young couples do.  We were equals, drifting into and around each-other. 

Ambition and recognition at work became less important, the more I found strength in her. She saw the man I could become in me. I was overwhelmed, immature and undeserving because I was not him yet. I didn't even stop to consider whether I wanted to be - let alone having similar views on her. The balance had shifted. 

We moved in together shortly after, another social milestone. The closer we got, the more we drifted apart. We were honest in our confusion and insecurities. Perhaps too much. The more we began to see ourselves and each-other as growing and developing beings, the more we realised that the support we thought we had found, was eroding, undependable. That's not what's supposed to happen. We both came to that conclusion, in isolation. 

She asked me if I wanted to marry her. I wasn't sure. I asked her if she wanted to have kids. She wasn't sure. I could have said yes. So could she. Both would have been a completely justifiable answers. Wine began to serve a different purpose as our couple status regressed to awkward roommates. We broke up not too long after. The initial relief was profound and healing. 

We remained friends and kept in touch. Neither of us seemed able to let go, not fully. In my mind she turned into a simpler creature from a simpler time - ambitious, beautiful, nurturing. And so did I. Without a need to open up and explore, life was easier. 

Eventually she began dating. I didn't, not really. I felt she was brave for putting herself in a position to be hurt. And hurt she was. She was lied to. Gaslit. Stalked. Raped. She told me bits and pieces whenever we met, which happened with time. I couldn't be there for her then any more than I could before. She resented me that. I can't say I blame her.
