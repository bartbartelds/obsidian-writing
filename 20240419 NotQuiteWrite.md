**two-toed tom**

By the time that University of Alabama professor Carl Carmer set down the legend of Two-Toed Tom in his book _Stars Fell on Alabama_, the creature was described as a “[red-eyed hell-demon](http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/alligator2.html)” that took the form of a 4-meter-long (14 ft) alligator. Although many locals on the Florida-Alabama line may claim that the legend is ancient, most accounts of Two-Toed Tom started circulating in the 1920s.

Principally located in the town of Florala, Alabama, Two-Toed Tom is reportedly a great carnivore who likes to feast on livestock. Furthermore, it’s believed that Two-Toed Tom earned his moniker after getting his foot caught in a trap, thereby severing two toes on his left foot.

The most widely repeated account concerning Two-Toed Tom concerns his battle with a farmer by the name of Pap Haines. After finding one of his mules grotesquely mauled, Haines and his sons filled 15 syrup buckets with dynamite and tossed them all into a pond where they believed that Two-Toed Tom was digesting his latest meal.

Tragically, all the dynamite did was drive Two-Toed Tom out of the water. Once on land, the creature snatched Haines’s 12-year-old granddaughter and killed her. A distraught Haines vowed vengeance, but he failed to kill the beast. As such, a common rumor is that Two-Toed Tom is impervious to bullets.

**the gray man**

Legend holds that the Gray Man is the ghost of a young man traveling from [Charleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina "Charleston, South Carolina") to see his fiancée in 1822.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gray_Man_(ghost)#cite_note-Oxford-3) On the way, he and his horse were caught in quicksand-like [pluff mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluff_mud "Pluff mud") in the marshes before Pawley's Island, and died. His spirit has haunted the shore nearby ever since, looking for the girl he loved.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gray_Man_(ghost)#cite_note-co-2)

Attempt 1:

"Y'all ain't been here long. But Wren's takin' a liking to y'all. Y'know that, right?"
Aster looks up from putting away the white cotton garments she had arrived in town in, a few days prior. Her eyes meet Avery's, followed by a nod. She had noticed. 
"Set you up real nice here, too." His voice trailed off as his eyes looked her over. 
Aster cast her eyes to the floorboards. 
Again a nod. It was true. The wooden house was well-kept, clearly recently vacant, situated at the edge of the dusty road that ran two carts wide through the heart of the town. 
Avery pads some dust off his clothes and removes his hat before crossing the threshold. 
" ... if it'd been up to him, y'all could stay right here for 100 years."
She cants hear head and watches him seat himself in a rickety chair. In the faint light of the oil lamp overhead, he reached for a small tin of chewing tobacco and stuffed an indulgent helping in his left cheek. 
"Y'all sure know how to put on the charm, don't ye." His grinned his teeth black. Aster did not engage. 
".... Problem is: this house ain't ol' Wren's to give. It was built by my grandpappy, and I aims to keep it. But my heart ain't of stone neither. So here's what we'll do, miss: y'all come out tomorrow, to the gathering in town square, wearin' your best linen, and stand in the Proceeding. And if y'all see fit to accommodate us, well ... we'll accommodate you. How's that sound?"
Avery stows away his tin and stretches out his legs, raking muddy boots across the floor. 
Aster meets his eyes with a disarming smile which she sustains so long it unsettles Avery. 
He clears his throat, and mutters a groan as he gets up. 
"Well then. Y'all 'll know when it's time." He greets her and turns to leave. Looking over his shoulder, he is met with Aster's unwavering smile. 

The townsfolk gather early dawn the next day, and congregate before a hastily-built dais, in front of the general store. The crowd is restless but soft spoken. The blessing from the minister does not alleviate the tension. Aster stands center stage in her finest white, flanked on either side by a city girl dressed in church whites. Neither seem of child bearing age.  Big Wren, sensing growing unease, takes center stage, nodding his appreciation to the retreating cleric. He clears his throat, and speaks in a deep baritone.

"The date is April 21st in the year of our Lord 1766 ..." He pauses, and lets his words resonate down main street. "... a decennary to the day since the last Proceeding. We stand here at this time to renew our bargain, and pay our Retribution."
Wren gestures to the girls, who turn away from Aster and leave the dais with the same solemn expression. Aster looks out over the crowd of people gathered in the morning mist. None meets her calm smile, opting to look away or shrug into hoods. 
"Miss Aster has seen fit to Stand at this time. And for this we owe her a hundred years of Gratitude." The gathering repeats the last five words in unison.

Wren nods his approval, and raises both his arms and voice skyward. "We stand ready, Gray Man. Come claim your prize." The townsfolk wait with baited breath, the silence is heavy. 

"There!" Wren points down street. The Gray Man emerges from the morning mist at the edge of town, astride a tall pale horse. He looks near translucent, garbed in grey cloth and black leathers. The footfalls of his horse grind gravel with deep thuds as it advances upon the congregation with deliberate intent. The gathering splits to allow him passage. Even Wren takes a step back.

Aster steps forward. She caresses the horse's manes gently, and takes the black gloved hand stretched out to her. The Gray Man hoists her up to sit behind him. She melts against his back, embracing him at the waist. The ride out of town is swift. Soon, Aster and the Gray Man dissolve into the morning mist, leaving the townsfolk in a mixture of relief and confusion where guilt had been expected. 

Avery lead the proceedings in Wren's stead, ten years down the road. The Gray Man did not come, however. Neither did he the decade after, and soon custom passed to forgotten memory. The town stood in prosperity until flash floods of 1866 washed it out to sea.

Aster looks up from putting away the white cotton garments she had arrived in town in, a few days prior. Her eyes meet Avery's, followed by a nod. She had noticed. 
" ... if it'd been up to him, y'all could stay right here for 'nother 100 years."
