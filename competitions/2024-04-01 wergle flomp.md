NOT SUBMITTED
One morose day in early spring, 
thick clouds dissuaded birds to sing, 
not a peep and not a chirp, 
not a tweep and not a twirp,
I watched and waited overlong, 
for signs that spring had truly sprung. 

In the distance loomed the city, 
swallowing commuters without pity,
and gorging on them throughout the day,
until finally frail and utterly drained,
only to, without grieving,
spit them out into the evening.

I watched this daily distant dance,
where as if in a trance, 
people of their own volition
were emptied, all, without omission, 
and struggle home at evensong, 
that morose day in early spring. 

The city pays seasons little mind, 
as, singular in constant grind, 
it churns and roils,
and burns and boils, 
consuming every little thing, 
that morose day in early spring.
