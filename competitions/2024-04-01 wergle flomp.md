My father rarely speaks to me. 
He usually sits, still like a tree,
and gaze out over the yard,
from the chair where he sits guard.

'New dog, from a few houses down',
he concludes with a vexed frown,
spotting the mutt with sharp disdain
its tail wagging happily in the rain,
encroaching on the chicken coop,
to say hi to the troupe. 

Before I can try to calm him down,
the window rattles with a pound, 
knocking dust of wood beams overhead
and alerts the pooch to pending threat. 

I wave meekly to the neighbour,
as puppy runs toward his saviour,
startled by the sudden clangour, 
I'd bring round cookies later. 

Dad once was a loving figure, 
but as his mind began to wither,
the homestead he himself had built
stayed fresh in mind, when all else wilted.

The people living two doors down, 
had only ever known his piercing frown.
The neighbour waves back his light dismissal
had gotten used to constant gristle. 

After dad had breathed his last,

NOT SUBMITTED
One morose day in early spring, 
thick clouds dissuaded birds to sing, 
not a peep and not a chirp, 
not a tweep and not a twirp,
I watched and waited overlong, 
for signs that spring had truly sprung. 

In the distance loomed the city, 
swallowing commuters without pity,
and gorging on them throughout the day,
until finally frail and utterly drained,
only to, without grieving,
spit them out into the evening.

I watched this daily distant dance,
where as if in a trance, 
people of their own volition
were emptied, all, without omission, 
and struggle home at evensong, 
that morose day in early spring. 

The city pays seasons little mind, 
as, singular in constant grind, 
it churns and roils,
and burns and boils, 
consuming every little thing, 
that morose day in early spring.
