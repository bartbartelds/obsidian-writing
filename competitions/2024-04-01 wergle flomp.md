My father rarely speaks to me. 
He usually sits, still like a tree,
and gaze out over the yard,
from the chair where he sits guard.

'New dog, from a few houses down',
he concludes with a vexed frown,
spotting the mutt with sharp disdain
its tail wagging  in the rain,
encroaching on the chicken coop,
to say hi to the troupe. 

Before I can try to calm him down,
the window rattles with a pound, 
knocking dust of wood beams overhead
and alerts the pooch to impending threat. 

I wave meekly to the neighbour,
as puppy runs toward his saviour,
startled by the sudden clangour, 
I'd bring 'round cookies later. 

Dad once was a loving figure, 
but as his mind began to wither,
the homestead he himself had built
stayed fresh in mind, when all else wilted.

The people living two doors down, 
had only ever known his piercing frown.
The neighbour waves back his light dismissal
had gotten used to constant gristle. 

After dad had breathed his last, 
and I made peace with recent past, 
we ended his unending watch,
toasted with a well-aged scotch,
and buried him under the heather
one cold morning, in foul weather. 

The very next spring, we sold the place
soon the house filled with kids to raise
with love and life and pets galore
they brought four terrier-labradors

we asked them to please keep the grounds
in the state they had found
they promised they most surely would
and set about their parenthood

The last time that I came around
to spend some time on native ground
I saw the four domestic terriers
relieve themselves near the wild heather.

I could have shooed the beasts away,
and kept my father's grave unstained, 
but as I watched, I felt dissuaded,
and allowed the procedure unabated.

The body that rests there would have been livid,
but I recall so piercingly vivid,
my father's laughing eyes, cried runny, 
and his gruff voice saying "damn, that's funny"







NOT SUBMITTED
One morose day in early spring, 
thick clouds dissuaded birds to sing, 
not a peep and not a chirp, 
not a tweep and not a twirp,
I watched and waited overlong, 
for signs that spring had truly sprung. 

In the distance loomed the city, 
swallowing commuters without pity,
and gorging on them throughout the day,
until finally frail and utterly drained,
only to, without grieving,
spit them out into the evening.

I watched this daily distant dance,
where as if in a trance, 
people of their own volition
were emptied, all, without omission, 
and struggle home at evensong, 
that morose day in early spring. 

The city pays seasons little mind, 
as, singular in constant grind, 
it churns and roils,
and burns and boils, 
consuming every little thing, 
that morose day in early spring.
