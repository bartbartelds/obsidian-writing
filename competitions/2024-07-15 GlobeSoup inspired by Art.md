We met at work. Many couples do, especially ambitious ones - they always seem to attract, no extra effort is required. Both full of drive and potential, neither which either of us fully understood. And both willing to advance, in whatever way opportunity presented itself. 

It took three months of office interaction, and a handful of wine-aided evenings for us to hook up. We bonded easily, over plainly visible problems and solutions, over responsibilities and duties. And as soon as we did, we did things young couples do.  We were equals, drifting into and around each-other. 

Ambition and recognition at work became less important, the more I found strength in her. She saw the man I could become in me. I was overwhelmed, immature and undeserving because I was not him yet. I didn't even stop to consider if I wanted to be - let alone having similar views on her. The balance had shifted. 

We moved in together shortly after. The closer we got, the more we drifted apart. We were honest in our confusion and insecurities. Perhaps too much. The more we began to see ourselves and each-other as growing and developing beings, the more we realised that the support we thought we had found was changing and undependable. That's not what's supposed to happen. We both came to that conclusion, separately. 

She asked me if I wanted to marry her. I wasn't sure. I asked her if she wanted to have kids. She wasn't sure. I could have said yes. So could she. Both would have been a completely justifiable answers. Wine began to serve a different purpose as our couple status regressed to awkward roommates. We broke up not too long after. The initial relief was profound and healing. 

We remained friends and kept in touch. Neither of us seemed able to let go, not fully. In my mind she turned into a simpler creature from a simpler time - ambitious, beautiful, nurturing. And so did I. Without a need to open up and explore, life was easier. 

Eventually she began dating. I never did, not really. I felt she was brave for putting herself in a position to be hurt. And hurt she was. She was lied to. Gaslit. Stalked. Raped. She told me bits and pieces whenever we met, which happened less with time. I couldn't be there for her any more than I could before. She resented me for that. I felt that was understandable. 

She became hard in her thoughts and reasoning. I felt a sense of responsibility, a guilt for tipping the first domino that cascaded into the experiences she had. The mental image I kept of her in no way resembled reality. I didn't expect it to, but at the same time I couldn't bare it. 

We don't talk anymore, broke up a second time. Her image is a memento, a construct, fake and beautiful. I look at it sometimes, when I'm brave enough. Undeserved, she's still there for me.

"How did he ever find this place?"
"Who knows. It's been here forever. Maybe he just moved in, you know. It was abandoned fifty years ago. I don't recall a time when it was in actual use."
The tall wooden doors were big enough to allow tractors and other motorised farming vehicles through. It took some doing, but eventually the dry wood groaned into motion, and heavy cast iron hinges creaked in protest. A watery sun hung in the december sky at our backs, debating ducking under the west horizon. Weak warm rays pushed back the shadows inside the tall wooden structure. Large shapes covered in white tarps. Workbenches, mostly kept tidy beside a layer of dust. Rows of storage along the east wall, object kept on them neatly spaced. There was a staircase running up the wall to our left, providing access to a crosswalk and three office spaces. 
"What did you say your dad did again?"
"He was an engineer for most of his life. At least that's what he used to tell people - including us. I asked Andrew and mom a few times. We think he actually worked for the army or something. 'R&D'." 
"Either that or he was a supervillain. Look at this place!"
Michael nodded as he began navigating the lanes between the vehicles and benches on careful steps. "Come on. But don't touch anything."
Melissa laughed, but quieted down when she saw Michael's expression and followed in his wake. 

"What are you looking for?"
"There's a basement in here somewhere. Probably at the back."
Melissa remained quiet, and let her hand brush over one of the shelves in passing, pulling a thick trail in the accumulated dust. 
" ... it's where he spent most of his time. All of this stuff, he didn't really care about."
"Ok ... sure. What's in the basement?"
"Just keep a look out for a hatch or whatever, leading down."
She nodded. The large covered shapes they passed began to look distinct from farming apparatus.
