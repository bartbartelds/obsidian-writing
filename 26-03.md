"Why do you do what you do, Ni?"
Niander kept rummaging in the mess of cables behind the rickety cupboard. 
An open palm bursts through the maelstrom of malfunctioning wires. 
"Hand me that thing."
Phi squints, hoping to identify the requested object in the gloom of the basement. A pair of stripping pliers. She collects the tool and thrusts it through the chaos and into the space behind. She feels him snap his fingers around her wrist, wrestling downstream and liberate the device from her outstretched hand. 
"Thank you." His voice sounds muffled and further away in the gloom than Phi expected. 
A series of grunts, bangs and malicious mumbles later, Phi notes one of the panels along the eastern wall starting to post signs of life. A screen flickered into action, and rippled with static before giving way to a blinking cursor awaiting instructions. 
The mass of cables and wires moved, pushed clear by Niander, creating a path for himself outside of the space behind the improvised scaffolding that holds racks of ... whatever. Phi perks a grin as she watches struggle for freedom, folding her arms across her chest. 

"Look." He groans, indicating the newly revived screen while shaking off the last errant cables like a dog. The screen had begun to spew out vertical lines of simplified Chinese. "You can read that shit, right?"
"Little racist there, Ni"
"Give me a break."
She did. Phi moved closer to the screen, to get a better look at the symbols fluttering across the monochrome screen. 
"What am I looking at?"
"You tell me", he responds, now fully free of the haphazardly intertwined collection of materials that filled up nearly every square inch of the room. He was an imposing figure, confined within dark of cellar. ##Phi wondered passing

"I ... don't know ..." Phi began responding. "It's an old dialect. I can read it, but I'm not sure what it means. Some of these sentences make no sense."
"It's something from before the levies broke. You know, when the bay flooded? I came across snippets of it while I was out prowling a few nights ago. At least I think I did - it needed some amplification."
Phi nods distractedly, now more intrigued by the lines on the screen. " ... You're right. But if that's true ... " She peels her eyes away from the screen, and levels her gaze at him, leaving her thought unfinished. 
"Do you know the source?"
"No, not exactly. The static isn't caused by imperfections in transmission. It seems to be part of the message itself."
Phi nods as she begins to recognize the repeating patterns scrolling over the screen. "You don't know what it says, do you?"
"No. That's why you're here, remember?"
"You never told me why you called."
Niander gives a dismissive gesture, as the main of his focus shifts to the worn office chair in front of the impressive array of screens and customized peripherals on the corner desk. The seat groans as he shifts his weight onto in. 
"Look at this."
Phi peels herself away from the screen and joins him. 
"There's more?"
He points and underlines utterances on several of the smaller screens flanking the main display in front of him, drawing a line in the film of fatty grime that has formed on their surface. "You see it, don't you."
Phi nods while she absently taps her chin. Her eyes drift up to the ceiling pensively. She allows herself a moment of distraction as she tries to mentally unravel the maze of cable and suspension overhead. 

"You never answered my question."
"Mine first."
"Fine", Phi yields. "It's not the same message. It's ... different. The jist is the same - a repeating pattern, sort of like an s.o.s. It's obviously automated, and somehow still being emitted. Wait ... what's the source of this stuff?"
Niander nods. "There you go."
"What on earth did you stumble into, Ni?" 
"I'm not sure. But it's the same thing. Kind of. But here's the thing that will freak you out: this isn't live data. It's old. And I mean ancient. It's a digitized reading of a couple of scrolls the English stole from ... I don't know ... some poor bastards, back on the dark ages or some shit."
"You're not serious."
"When have you ever known me to not be serious."
"I said you don't have a sense of humor - that's different."
"Fuck you, Phi. But yeah."

She nods, catching his meaning. "And you want me to .... "
" ... do what you do best. Go sleuthing, or whatever you call what you do these days. I can pay. Got lucky last week. Three thousand. "
" You know I can't take your money, Ni."
He pushes aside a shard, and places it before her on the desktop. "Take it. I'm not a charity case. And this isn't a charity request."
Phi picks up the device and slips it into the breast lining pocket of her jacket. "Fine, regular rate then. What are you not telling me?"
