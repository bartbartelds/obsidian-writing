Prompt 1: Shaky Ground - 15 minutes

Groningen, north. 

There's a village, just a couple of miles north of here. A small village, like many others, with a church and a small market, a modest school, one or two stores, some farms, some cattle, and some modest locals who chose it, and settled. I remember how my father took me bike riding up north, and how we'd pass through many like it, each more idyllic than the next. The straw roofs, the big oaks, the sounds of animals from the stables and the fields was calming, reassuring, a home that had never been mine, but home nonetheless. 

The village lays in ruins now, along with many like it. With fissures ripped in walls, brick and mortar torn apart, with barns collapsed and churches crumbled, stores vacated and people gone, moved on to greener pastures. The ones who stayed behind, live a life of warning tape, supporting struts, uncertainty and despair. The weather was lovely, the oaks stood tall. Which was somehow the saddest of it all. 

The cause of the collapse was explained to the locals in clinical terms. They bore no guilt. Due to the mining of natural gas, the earth had shifted far beneath them, their houses, their villages and schools, barns and cattle. It had destroyed them, without warning. The most clinical element of all came at the end: there would be no help for those who had chosen to live on shaky ground.

Prompt 2: Eclipse hooky - 15 minutes

She beckoned me, under her desk, making sure nobody saw. I noticed her efforts at the second of third try, just when her smile was starting to show signs of frustration, jaw clenching slightly, only to relax in joy as I perked a brow. I nodded, unsure of what I was getting myself into. 

She got up, slipped into the corridor connecting cubicles, and waiting for me at the end of the main hallway to the cafeteria. I sheepishly followed, leaving my work unattended and untidy. She scanned left and right for casual onlookers, and then grabbed my hand, yanking my enthusiastically toward the fire escape before I could so much as yelp. 

She went up ahead of me, ever up the square stairs, each small section of ascent interspersed with a level crossing. The walls were rough concrete, unfinished, the lights harsh and fluorescent. The view was great. 

Up on the roof she turned to me, whirling around with arms stretched out, the city as her canvas. I stepped closer. When my eyes met hers, all went dark and our lips met.
