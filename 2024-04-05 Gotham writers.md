Shaky Ground - 15 minutes

Betrayal, anger, 

There's a village, just a couple of miles north of here. A small village, like many others, with a church and a small market, a modest school, one or two stores, some farms, some cattle, and some modest locals who chose it, and settled. I remember how my father took me bike riding up north, and how we'd pass through many like it, each more idyllic than the next. The straw roofs, the big oaks, the sounds of animals from the stables and the fields was calming, reassuring, a home that had never been mine, but home nonetheless. 

The village lays in ruins now, along with many like it. With fissures ripped in walls, brick and mortar torn apart, with barns collapsed and churches crumbled.
