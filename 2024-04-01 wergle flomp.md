One morose morning, early spring, 
heavy clouds dissuaded birds to sing, 
not a peep and not a chirp, 
not a tweep and not a twirp,
I watched and waited overlong, 
for signs that spring had truly sprung. 

In the distance loomed the city, 
swallowing commuters without pity,
and gorging on them throughout the day,
until finally frail and utterly drained,
only to, without grieving,
regurgitate them upon the evening.

I watched this daily distant dance,
where as if in a trance, 
people of their own volition
sought to be 
and struggle home at evensong, 
one morose day, early spring.
